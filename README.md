UniShade is a safe non-injection version of reshade white works on any game that supports captureing using the wgc method. this is mainly for roblox at the moment as people from the roblox comunity really want shaders back and i decided i wanted to make that possible. these shaders include a bunch of presets that i customly tweaked to look like they are 3d effects such as ssr.fx and mxao.fx (all credits to the creators for all the effects). UniShade runs as an overlay that sits ontop of a target window so that measn it does not inject what so ever and is just a 2d overlay that sits ontop of a window.
